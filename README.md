## Features
### 1. Custom Workout Challenges
Users can create custom workout challenges with specific goals (e.g., reps, weight, etc.) and challenge other users to complete them. Challenges are a core part of Gym Royale, motivating users to push their limits and improve their fitness performance.

### 2. Rank-based Competition
Gym Royale features a ranking system based on completed challenges:
- Bronze
- Silver
- Gold
- Legendary

Ranks are calculated from the metrics of previous challenges completed, and users can progress through these ranks based on their performance. Higher ranks showcase greater fitness accomplishments.

### 3. Rank Lobbies and Social Interaction
Users can interact with others in the same rank lobby by:
- Viewing Other Users' Experience and Rank Levels: See how you compare with others in your rank.
- Commenting on Challenges: Each challenge in the lobby has a dedicated comment section where users can engage in discussions or give feedback.

### 4. Daily Bounty
A special "Daily Bounty" is available, providing additional incentives for users to complete random workouts. These workouts are designed to offer variety and a chance to earn extra experience points. Completing a Daily Bounty challenge rewards bonus experience, helping users level up faster.

### 5. User Profiles
Gym Royale allows users to customize their profiles, making it more personalized:
- Edit Profile Name and Description: Users can update their display name and add a brief description about themselves.
- Select Profile Picture: Choose from a selection of profile pictures to represent your identity in the app.
